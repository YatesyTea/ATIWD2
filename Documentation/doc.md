# Task 1 & 2

## Selection of technology area:

* What I chose:

  > Chose HTML 5/ CSS 3 

* Why:

  > Very heavily documented
  > Familiarity
  > Open format

* Other considerations:

  > Cloud based
  > Single Page
  > Backbone
  > Django

## Context of Use:

Html 5:

* Most common markdown language for content to display
* Stands for Hyper-text Markup Language
* Used in web creation
* Used in conjuction with a large amount of other technologies (such as css, js, php)

CSS3:

* Stands for Cascading Style Sheets
* Is used to apply styles and organisation to HTML content
* Has a framework known as CSS Grid inbuilt, this removes the requirement to use JavaScript for the purpose of page organisation which makes less interactive websites able to be backwards compatible with outdated browsers used in business, albeit with sometimes lacklustre layouts for such browsers.

## Relevance to WWW:

This image of the html spec was as of 2013

S. Mavrody (2012), Sergey's HTML5 & CSS3 Quick Reference: HTML5, CSS3 and APIs (3rd Edition), Belisso.

Since the initial release of HTML5; the development specification has increased in scope.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Pros

* Near ubiquity
* Easily auto generated from other languages, databases etc.
* Largely backwards compatible
  * CSS Grid --> old IE shows diff version auto
  * Minimal functionality loss in comparison to new JS projects
* Widespread understanding and well documented
* Open Source
* Clear specification

### Cons

* Some claim a bloated spec
* When used on it's own is largely static
* Working draft sections prone to bugs
* Specification changes can lead to outdated pages
